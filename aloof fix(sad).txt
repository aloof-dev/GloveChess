THIS FINALLY WORKS WITH THE LATEST PYTHON 3.14
STILL UNSATABLE ASF EVEN AFTER MAKING 30 CHANGES
BLAME OpenGL for it , had to add many functions to compensate for the c++ asuumtion in previos .py version 
IF ANY MORE ERROR OCCUR , it most probably is due to dependencies not working properly , so just write the eroor function and don't depend on the library
